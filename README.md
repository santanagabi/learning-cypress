This repository is dedicated to the coursework of the **Cypress - Modern Automation Testing from Scratch + Frameworks** course by Rahul Shetty. Through this course, I am gaining in-depth knowledge and practical experience in using Cypress for modern automation testing. The course covers various frameworks and techniques to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of web testing.

To run the tests in this repository, make sure you have Cypress installed. If not, you can install it by running the following command:
```bash
npm install cypress
```

Once Cypress is installed, execute the following command to open the Cypress Test Runner:
```bash
npx cypress open
```

The Cypress Test Runner provides a user-friendly interface to execute and manage the tests included in this repository. Feel free to explore the different test scenarios and projects available.

I hope this repository and the coursework help you in mastering Cypress and becoming proficient in modern automation testing. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy testing! üòÅ
